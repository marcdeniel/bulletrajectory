this is a physics simulation of bullet trajectoy
 
bullet's position over time (matplotlib)

gravity at 9.8 m/s

and air drag at 1.225

v0 = initial velocity
angle at launch in relation to the horizontal 
drag force  at   F_d = 0.5 * C_d * rho * A * v**2

and the cross sectional area of the bullet

**Drag Force**
Resistive force in the opposing direction of a projectile's travel through a medium such as air
Drag Force increases proportional to projectile's speed.

F_d = \frac{1}{2} C_d \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot v^2
